🎤 💯 FINAL PROJECT EXPLANATION

“This project is a multilingual political sentiment analysis system that uses translation, machine learning, and visualization to analyze public opinion.”

🎤 🔥 MAIN VIVA POWER LINE

“After optimizing dataset quality and feature extraction, the model achieved around 78% accuracy on political sentiment classification.”

🧠 COMPLETE FEATURE EXPLANATION (VIVA READY)
🌐 Multilingual Support

“The system accepts input in multiple languages and translates it into English for consistent processing.”

🔄 Translation System

“We use automatic translation to normalize different languages into a single format before prediction.”

🧠 Machine Learning Model

“We use Logistic Regression for classification due to its efficiency and strong performance on text data.”

📊 Feature Engineering (TF-IDF)

“TF-IDF converts text into numerical features while capturing important words and phrases using n-grams.”

⚖️ Class Balancing

“We applied class weights to handle imbalance and improve prediction fairness across all classes.”

📈 Confidence Score

“The model outputs probability scores to indicate confidence in predictions.”

📊 Visualization

“We use bar and pie charts to display sentiment distribution and model confidence.”

📂 CSV Analysis

“The system supports bulk analysis by processing entire datasets and predicting sentiment for each row.”

💾 Database Storage

“All predictions are stored in SQLite for tracking and historical analysis.”

🧹 Text Preprocessing

“We clean text by removing noise like punctuation and stopwords to improve model accuracy.”

🌐 Language Detection Handling

“For mixed language inputs like Hinglish, we label detection as ‘unknown’ and rely on translation.”

⚡ Performance Optimization

“We optimized CSV processing using selective translation and progress tracking.”

🤖 Explanation System

“The system provides simple explanations to help users understand predictions.”

🎨 UI/UX

“We designed a modern glassmorphism UI using Streamlit for better user experience.”

🚨 Limitations

“The model may struggle with subtle or contextual sentiment due to limitations of classical ML.”

🚀 Future Improvements

“We can improve accuracy using transformer models like BERT for better context understanding.”

📊 YOUR FINAL RESULT

“The model achieved approximately 78% accuracy, which indicates good performance for a domain-specific multilingual dataset.”

🎯 SHORT SUMMARY (IF THEY ASK QUICKLY)

“It’s a multilingual political sentiment analyzer using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression with around 78% accuracy.”
